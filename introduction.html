	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	
	<p><i>@esop</i> is a collaboratively authored interactive book modeled after The Library of Congress' remediation of <i>The Aesop</i>. The fables of <i>@esop</i> engage with scenes of teaching and learning relevant to the experiences of young adults living in the twenty-first century. Some of these scenes are mundane and humorous, others are gravely serious. Rather than providing pre-fabricated wisdom packaged as a "moral" or "lesson," the assembled fables in @esop ask questions. While traditional fables seek to disseminate traditional values or reveal aspects of humans' everyday interactions, <i>@esop</i> seeks to provoke discussion about those values and interactions. <i>@esop</i> is not didactic, but rather problem-posing.</p>

	<p>Each contributing author first wrote two original fables modeled after those found in <i>The Aesop</i>, before composing images and sounds to accompany their individually authored fables. The authors then evaluated and critiqued each other's individually authored fables, ultimately voting on an image and sound template on which to model all of their fables. Then, working in small groups, the authors chose a handful of images to "animate" by adding movement to the already rich tableau of composition modalities.</p>

	<p>The final stage required authors to standardize the written, design, and coding elements of <i>@esop</i>  before organizing the individual fables and linking them together with easy-to-use web-based navigation system and hosting them.</p>

	<p>Though Aesop was certainly a real person, "Aesop" likely refers to a colletion of ancient story-tellers, all of whom told stories and shared lessons with young children. Ultimately, the tales of these different pedagogues were gathered together and re-presented as the collected stories of one man. Similarly, <i>@esop</i> is a collaboratively authored collection of stories and questions presented as a unified book.</p>
