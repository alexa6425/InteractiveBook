# Interactive Book

A collection of short stories from a Digital Media class of 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh.

These are the files needed outside of each student's individual fables.

How to make a duplicate of this project:

1. Download the files contained here onto a web server
2. Replace links as necessary in bookify.js in the variables `fable_order`
3. Put online somewhere!

Please not that each person's fables are hosted separately to the index and table of contents. There is no guarantee that each person's fables will persist at the location currently in bookify.js
